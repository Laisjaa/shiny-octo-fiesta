In the next two years, I see myself completing my Bachelor's in Life Sciences, with a solid set of skills in Bioinformatics. I'm really excited to dive deeper into the field and become comfortable with using tools like R and Python to analyze biological data. To get there, I’m committed to improving my programming and problem-solving skills every day, whether it's by working on coding exercises, learning new bioinformatics techniques, or experimenting with real-world datasets. I’m eager to continue learning and apply what I know to actual bioinformatics problems, whether in academic projects or through personal practice
